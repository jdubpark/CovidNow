                  <p>COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, can infect people of any age. However, older adults or individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.</p>

                  <p>COVID-19 causes illness that does, indeed, have flu-like symptoms, such as aches, fever, and cough. Similarly, both COVID-19 and flu can be mild, severe, or, in rare cases, fatal. Both can also lead to pneumonia.</p>
                  <p>However, the overall profile of COVID-19 is more serious. Estimates vary, but its mortality rate seems to be between about 1% and 3%, compared to around 0.1% for the flu.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, there is currently no vaccine available for COVID-19, which means anyone can get exposed and infected by the virus. Estimates vary, but the vaccine development process can take at least a year since it was first discovered.</p>

              <div class="dsec-content">
                <div class="short-answer"><span>Short answer:</span> Only certain masks help, but there are better ways to protect yourself.</div>
                <div class="elaborate">
                  <p>Healthcare workers use professional face masks, which fit tightly around the face, to protect them against infection. However, disposable face masks are unlikely to provide such protection. As these masks do not fit neatly against the face, droplets can still enter the mouth and nose. Also, tiny viral particles can penetrate directly through the material.</p>
                  <p>However, if someone has a respiratory illness, wearing a mask can help protect others from becoming infected.</p>
                  <p>“There is very little evidence that wearing such masks protects the wearer from infection,” Dr. Ben Killingley, Consultant in Acute Medicine and Infectious Diseases at University College London Hospital in the U.K., explains.</p>
                  <p>“Furthermore, wearing masks can give a false sense of reassurance and might lead to other infection control practices being ignored, e.g., hand hygiene.”</p>
                  <p>The WHO recommend that people who are caring for someone with suspected COVID-19 should wear a mask. In these cases, wearing a mask is only effective if the individual regularly washes their hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.</p>
                  <p>Also, when using a mask, it is important to use it and dispose of it properly.</p>

                <div class="short-answer"><span>Short answer:</span> No, antibiotics can't kill COVID-19.</div>
                <div class="elaborate">
                  <p>Antibiotics only kill bacteria but NOT viruses because of their nature. Viruses hijack into living cells and reproduce, thereby disguishing as normal cells. Antibiotics aren't designed to kill normal cells.</p>
                  <p>In fact, taking antibiotics can temporarily weaken the immune system, which can aid the virus in reproduction. Take antibiotics only for other bacteria-related conditions.</p>
